It appears that YouTrack is warning about not using non-anonymous volumes for its data, configuration, logs, and backups. To address this, you need to modify the `.helm/templates/10-app.yaml` file to include Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) for these directories and mount them to the appropriate paths within the YouTrack container.

1. Add Persistent Volume Claims to the `.helm/templates/10-app.yaml` file:

Add the following PVCs after the existing `youtrack-data-claim` PVC:

```yaml
# Persistent Volume Claim for configuration
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: youtrack-conf-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

# Persistent Volume Claim for logs
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: youtrack-logs-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

# Persistent Volume Claim for backups
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: youtrack-backups-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```

2. Update the Deployment section in the `.helm/templates/10-app.yaml` file:

Modify the `containers` section to include volume mounts for the new PVCs:

```yaml
containers:
  - name: youtrack
    image: {{ .Values.werf.image.youtrack }}
    env:
      - name: DATABASE_URL
        value: {{ .Values.youtrack.db.url }}
      - name: DATABASE_USER
        value: {{ .Values.youtrack.db.user }}
      - name: DATABASE_PASSWORD
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: {{ .Chart.Name }}-db-secret
            key: password
    ports:
      - containerPort: 8080
    volumeMounts:
      - name: youtrack-data
        mountPath: /opt/youtrack/data
      - name: youtrack-conf
        mountPath: /opt/youtrack/conf
      - name: youtrack-logs
        mountPath: /opt/youtrack/logs
      - name: youtrack-backups
        mountPath: /opt/youtrack/backups
```

3. Update the `spec` section of the Deployment to include the new volumes:

```yaml
spec:
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: registrysecret
  containers:
    - name: youtrack
      # ... (rest of the container settings)
  volumes:
    - name: youtrack-data
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: youtrack-data-claim
    - name: youtrack-conf
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: youtrack-conf-claim
    - name: youtrack-logs
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: youtrack-logs-claim
    - name: youtrack-backups
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: youtrack-backups-claim
```

After making these changes, commit and push them to the GitLab repository. The GitLab CI/CD pipeline should now deploy JetBrains YouTrack to your AWS K8s cluster managed by Deckhouse and built with werf.io with the proper volume mounts for data, configuration, logs, and backups.



I apologize for the inconvenience. The issue might be caused by incorrect permissions or other issues with the mounted volumes. To debug the issue, please follow these steps:

1. Check the logs of the YouTrack container:

Run the following command to get the logs of the YouTrack container:

```bash
kubectl logs -n <namespace> <youtrack-pod-name> youtrack
```

Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace where the YouTrack application is deployed, and `<youtrack-pod-name>` with the name of the YouTrack pod.

2. Check the logs of the init container:

Run the following command to get the logs of the init container:

```bash
kubectl logs -n <namespace> <youtrack-pod-name> -c volume-permissions
```

Replace `<namespace>` and `<youtrack-pod-name>` as mentioned earlier.

3. Inspect the YouTrack pod:

Run the following command to describe the YouTrack pod:

```bash
kubectl describe pod -n <namespace> <youtrack-pod-name>
```

Replace `<namespace>` and `<youtrack-pod-name>` as mentioned earlier.

4. Check the status of the Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs):

Run the following command to check the status of the PVCs:

```bash
kubectl get pvc -n <namespace>
```

Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace where the YouTrack application is deployed.

Please provide the output of these commands to help identify the issue causing the container to crash.
